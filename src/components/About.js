              Hi, I'm Ray He. <strong>Authentically loving the act of programming.</strong> Genuine and dedicated Full Stack Web developer with experience in Github version control, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, Handlebars, MySQL, CSS, HTML, currently studying MongoDB and React. I'm passionate about all things code, learning new things. In a previous career I was a customer service and sales team leader.

              With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project. I worked on a team of four to develop a web app that helps users to plan their travel by fetching data and scenery about the destination. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
